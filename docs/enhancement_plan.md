# Enhancement Plan for Transformer Classifier

## 1. Advanced Mixture of Experts (MoE)

### Hierarchical Expert Routing
- Implement multiple layers of experts with hierarchical routing
- Each layer specializes in different aspects of the data
- Top layer: broad patterns
- Middle layer: specific genomic regions
- Bottom layer: fine-grained feature interactions

### Load-Balanced Top-K Routing
- Replace single expert selection with top-k routing
- Implement token-based load balancing
- Add auxiliary loss for expert utilization
- Include capacity-based gating mechanism

### Expert Diversity
- Add auxiliary loss to encourage expert specialization
- Implement expert dropout for robustness
- Add expert pruning during training
- Include expert importance scoring

## 2. Multimodal Enhancement

### Input Modalities
- Methylation data (primary modality)
- Clinical features (secondary modality)
- Genomic annotations (tertiary modality)

### Modality-Specific Encoders
- Methylation encoder: Enhanced transformer with spatial awareness
- Clinical encoder: MLP with feature embedding
- Annotation encoder: Graph neural network for genomic context

### Cross-Modal Attention
- Implement cross-attention between modalities
- Add modality-specific attention masks
- Include modality importance weighting
- Implement adaptive fusion mechanism

### Fusion Strategies
- Early fusion: Input-level concatenation
- Middle fusion: Feature-level interaction
- Late fusion: Decision-level ensemble
- Dynamic fusion: Attention-based weighting

## 3. Spatial-Aware Training

### Genomic Position Integration
